# Scroll-Adventure
Flash game where the player scrolls the screen like a web page on mobile phones, but if the page wasn't rectangular but more complex shape. The screen resists and bounces back with iOS-style physics and slides satisfyingly around corners and obstacles. First developed in Flash but later moved to Unity.
